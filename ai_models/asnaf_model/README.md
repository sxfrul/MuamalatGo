# ðŸ•Œ Asnaf Classification & Priority Listing

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook that builds and applies a machine learning model to classify and prioritize **asnaf** recipients based on synthetic data.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

The notebook `asnaf_classification_priority_list.ipynb` is divided into two main parts:

1. **Model Training**  
   - Trains a classification model using `train_data_synthetic.csv`
   - The model learns to identify and categorize different types of asnaf

2. **Priority Prediction**  
   - Applies the trained model on `test_data_synthetic.csv`
   - Generates a **priority-sorted name list** of predicted asnaf recipients

Simply click on the notebook file to view the full analysis, including preprocessing, training steps, and output generation.
